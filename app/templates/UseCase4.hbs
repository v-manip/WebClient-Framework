    <h1>Hi there, </h1>
    <p>here you can see one of the use case applications of the V-MANIP Project. This application demonstrates how comparison between Volume Weather Radar Data and Vertical Curtain Amospheric Satellite Data can be achieved through parallel visualization.</p>
    <p>This tutorial banner will present to you the available functionality and tools needed to visualize and compare the data.</p>
    <p>We will go through the available tools and visualizations as a tutorial which can be scrolled through. </p>
    <p>Under the parent <a href="http://demo.v-manip.eox.at/validation/">website</a> you can find the the different use case Apps, where again a banner like this will walk you through the steps for different tools. We recommend you to have a look at them too.</p>
    <p>You can always close this banner and play around with the system to get acquanted to it.</p>

    <h2>Layer Selection</h2>
    <p>Let us first have a look at the available user interface elements (widgets). </p>
    <p>I opened up the <strong>Layer/Product Widget</strong>. You can open and close it at any time by clicking in the navigation bar on the Layers button with the symbol <i class="fa fa-fw fa-globe"></i>.</p>
    <p>The Layer/Product Widget allows activating and deactivating the configured products, which are then visualized in the different viewers.</p>
    <p>You can move the widget to another position by clicking and dragging on its header, give that a try.</p>
    <p>The Widget shows base layers (e.g. Terrain), overlay layers (e.g. Streets) and product layer.</p>
    <p>Transparency can be set by slider that appears by clicking on the circle icon of the product.</p>
</section>
<section data-layers="Radar_Bonn_UH;Cloudsat">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Time Slider</h2>
    <p>We now activated the Radar Bonn UH and Cloudsat product layers for you, you can activate/deactivate product layers by clicking on the product checkbox in the Layer Selection Widget.</p>
    <p>If you look at the Time Slider at the bottom of the screen, you can now see ticks in the color displayed in the Layer Selection Widget for each product.</p>
    <p>Hovering with the mouse over a point will reveal the coverage id and by clicking on it you will automatically zoom to the extent of the coverage.</p>
    <p>In order to compare two products we will need to select a time where both are available and they overlap in space, we will do that in the next step.</p>
</section>
<section data-time="2013-05-17T12:40:09Z/2013-05-17T12:44:38Z">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <p>We selected the time interval for you, as you can see it is the dark grey area added in the Time Slider.</p>
    <p>Now we can see the outlines of the radar data and the line outline of the curtain on the map.</p>
    <p>In order to visualize the products we can use the Slice Viewer.</p>
</section>
<section data-events="ui:open:toolselection">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>To open the Slice Viewer we need to activate the Split Window mode. This can be done in the Tools pane.</p>
    <p>We opened it automatically for you but as the Layer Widget you can open and close the Tool Widget by clicking on the Tools button with the icon <i class="fa fa-fw fa-wrench"></i>.</p>
    <p>In the next step we will open the split view mode, this can also be done by clicking on the Split View Button <i class="fa fa-pause"></i> in the Tools panel.</p>
</section>
<section data-events="layout:switch:splitview" data-tr="SliceViewer">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Split View</h2>
    <p>Now that we activated the split view, we can see the map on the left and the Slice Viewer on the right.</p>
    <p>The views can be changed with the 4 bottons displayed in the top left of each of the visualization windows. Each icon represents a visualization method.</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-picture-o"/> 2D Map Visualization</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-globe"/> 3D Virtual Globe</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-inbox"/> Rectangular Box Viewer</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-bars"/> Slice Viewer</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-bar-chart-o"/> Analytics Viewer</p>
    <p>Now that we have selected two products (Radar Bonn UH and Cloudsat) and the time of interest we just need to select an area we are interested in. Let me do that for you, keep scrolling</p>
</section>
<section data-selection="data/uc4_data.geojson">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Selection</h2>
    <p>The radar data is very large, so please wait a little until it appears in the slice viewer.</p>
    <p>When loaded you can see the radar data on the right, in order to see inside the data please play around with the treshhold values and color in the Rada_Bonn_UH 1 controls.</p>
    <p>If we want to see the cloudsat curtain on a virtual globe we can just switch the 2D map view to the virtual globe on the left. Keep on scrolling.</p>
</section>
<section data-tl="VirtualGlobeViewer">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Virtual Globe Viewer</h2>
    <p>On the left you can see now the vertical curtain, you can pan by clicking and dragging with the mouse and you can change the look angle by pressing the middle mouse button.</p>
    <p>I is also possible to change the color table of the curtains using the Options tool <i class="fa fa-tasks"/>.</p>
</section>
<section data-events="ui:open:options">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Visualization Options</h2>
    <p>Feel free to change the attributes on the opened widget to see the changes real time on the curtain.</p>
    <p>Feel free to keep playing with the Web Application to test its functionalities.</p>
