    <h1>Hi there, </h1>
    <p>here you can see one of the use case applications of the V-MANIP Project. This application demonstrates how comparison between volume data such as model or satellite data can be achieved through simultaneous volume visualization</p>
    <p>This tutorial banner will present to you the available functionality and tools needed to visualize and compare the data.</p>
    <p>We will go through the available tools and visualizations as a tutorial which can be scrolled through. </p>
    <p>Under the parent <a href="http://demo.v-manip.eox.at/validation/">website</a> you can find the the different use case Apps, where again a banner like this will walk you through the steps for different tools. We recommend you to have a look at them too.</p>
    <p>You can always close this banner and play around with the system to get acquanted to it.</p>

    <h2>Layer Selection</h2>
    <p>Let us first have a look at the available user interface elements (widgets). </p>
    <p>I opened up the <strong>Layer/Product Widget</strong>. You can open and close it at any time by clicking in the navigation bar on the Layers button with the symbol <i class="fa fa-fw fa-globe"></i>.</p>
    <p>The Layer/Product Widget allows activating and deactivating the configured products, which are then visualized in the different viewers.</p>
    <p>You can move the widget to another position by clicking and dragging on its header, give that a try.</p>
    <p>The Widget shows base layers (e.g. Terrain), overlay layers (e.g. Streets) and product layer.</p>
    <p>Transparency can be set by slider that appears by clicking on the circle icon of the product.</p>
</section>
<section data-layers="GOME-2;BASCOE">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Time Slider</h2>
    <p>We now activated the GOME and BASCOE product layers for you, you can activate/deactivate product layers by clicking on the product checkbox in the Layer Selection Widget.</p>
    <p>If you look at the Time Slider at the bottom of the screen, you can now see circles in the color displayed in the Layer Selection Widget.</p>
    <p>These points indicate when there is data available for each product.</p>
    <p>In order to compare various products we will need to select a time where data is available, we will do that in the next step.</p>
</section>
<section data-time="2008-08-09T21:30:00Z/2008-08-10T02:30:00Z">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <p>We selected the time interval for you, as you can see it is the dark grey area added in the Time Slider.</p>
    <p>Now we can see the outlines of both products on the map as red rectangles.</p>
    <p>The outlines for BASCOE are actually at the borders of the map, as this product covers the whole extent.</p>
    <p>In order to compare the values at a specific area we will need to open the Slice Viewer and make a selection.</p>
</section>
<section data-events="ui:open:toolselection">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>To open the Slice Viewer we need to activate the Split Window mode. This can be done in the Tools pane.</p>
    <p>We opened it automatically for you but as the Layer Widget you can open and close the Tool Widget by clicking on the Tools button with the icon <i class="fa fa-fw fa-wrench"></i>.</p>
    <p>In the next step we will open the split view mode, this can also be done by clicking on the Split View Button <i class="fa fa-pause"></i> in the Tools panel.</p>
</section>
<section data-events="layout:switch:splitview" data-tr="SliceViewer">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Split View</h2>
    <p>Now that we activated the split view, we can see the map on the left and the Analytics Box Viewer on the right.</p>
    <p>The views can be changed with the 4 bottons displayed in the top left of each of the visualization windows. Each icon represents a visualization method.</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-picture-o"/> 2D Map Visualization</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-globe"/> 3D Virtual Globe</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-inbox"/> Rectangular Box Viewer</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-bars"/> Slice Viewer</p>
    <p><i class="fa fa-bar-chart-o"/> Analytics Viewer</p>
    <p>Now that we have selected three products (ALARO and AROME Specific Humidity as well as MOD07 Retrieved Temperature Profile) and the time of interest we just need to select a point we are interested to be displayed as plot. Let me do that for you, keep scrolling</p>
</section>
<section data-selection="data/uc5_data.geojson"  data-zoom="0" data-longitude="40" data-latitude="0">
    <span class="close">&#215;</span>
    <h2>Selection</h2>
    <p>As you can see now an area was selected and in the Slice Viewer you can see two volumes. </p>
    <p>It is possible to change the color for each one and set upper and lower treshhold values individually.</p>
    <p>By deactivating the volume rendering checkbox it is also possible to see the volumes slices in each axis.</p>
    <p>This slices can be moved by dragging on the index X, Y and Z bars where X represents longitude, Y represents latitude and Z represents height.</p>
    <p>Feel free to play around a little with this web application, you can close the tutorial by clicking on the x.</p>
