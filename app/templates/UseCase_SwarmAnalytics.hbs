    <h2>Swarm Analytics</h2>
    <p>This Tutorial demonstrates the necessary steps to visualize and analyse Swarm data.</p>
    <p>It is an interactive Tutorial so you just need to scroll down to see the prototypes functionality.</p>
    <p>The tutorial can be closed at any point in time.</p>

    <h3>Layer Selection</h3>
    <p>In order to visualise a product we first have to activate it in the Layer Selection Window.</p>
    <p>We have just opened it, you can see it on the left side of the screen.</p>
    <p>You can open and close it at any time by clicking in the navigation bar (top of the screen) on the <i class="fa fa-fw fa-globe"/> Layers button.</p>
    <p>You can move the window to another position by clicking and dragging on its header.</p>
    <p>A product can be activated by clicking on its corresponding check box.</p>
    <p>Transparency can be set by slider which appears when clicking the <i class="fa fa-adjust"/>-symbol of a layer.</p>

    <h3>Settings</h3>
    <p>The Swarm A L1b product has been activated now and is rendered in the virtual globe visualisation.</p>
    <p>The availability of the product is additionally displayed in the bottom time-line as well as the currently selected time interval. You can create a new time interval selection by clicking and dragging on the time-line. The current time selection (grey area) can also be modified by clicking and dragging it or extending the (left and right) edges.</p>
    <p>It is possible to zoom in and out using the mouse wheel over the time-line as well as panning by clicking and dragging on the bottom of the time-line.</p>
    <p>Additionally we opened the product settings window (on the right). Product settings can be accessed by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-gears"/>-symbol of a product.</p>
    <p>In the product settings you can select which parameter to visualise, what color scale to use and the range for the color scale.</p>
    <p>Swarm products have two parameters for visualisation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left:-15px;">Magnetic Field Intensity</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left:-15px;">Magnetic Field Vector</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At any point you can use the "Save as Image" button of the Virtual Globe (top right) to save the current visualisation.</p>

    <h2>Geomagnetic Field Model</h2>
    <p>As you can see on the virtual globe we now activated a Geomagnetic Field Model product (more information about this can be found in the "Geomagnetic Field Model" Tutorial).</p>
    <p>This allows a visual comparison between model and measurements.</p>

    <span class="close"><i class="fa fa-times-circle"/></span>
    <h2>Residuals</h2>
    <p>When a Swarm product is selected in combination with one of the Geomagnetic Field Model products it is also possible to see the Horizontal Magnetic Field Residuals by selecting the Magnetic Field Vector parameter in the Settings window (which we have done right now).</p>
    <p>As you can see now the Horizontal Magnetic Field Residuals are visualised on the virtual globe.</p>

<section data-events="layout:switch:splitview" data-settings="SW_OPER_MAGA_LR_1B">

    <h3>Analytics Viewer</h3>
    <p>We now opened the split screen mode which allows further analysis of the data.</p>
    <p>The split view can be opened by opening the <i class="fa fa-wrench"/> Tools widget on the navigation bar on the top and clicking on the <i class="fa fa-pause"/> Split screen button.</p>
    <p>The Analytics Viewer (right side of the screen) is divided into two sections.</p>
    <p> On the top half there is an interactive Scatter Plot of the selected data (right now residuals of Swarm A L1b and Swarm Initial Field Model).
        At the Drop-Down element situated on the top of the left axis, the parameter(s) to be plotted on that axis can be selected. At the Drop-Down element situated on the right of the bottom axis, the parameter to plot against can be selected.</p>
    <p>On the bottom half of the Analytics Viewer axes are represented for each parameter and a histogramm which visualises the amount of data at different ranges.
        It is possible to click and drag on the axes to create filters for the visualised data.</p>
    <p>The buttons on the top right allow adding a grid to the Scatter plot (Toggle Grid), save the plot as png (Save as Image) and Download the original Swarm data based on the created filters (Download).</p>

    <h2>Swarm Product</h2>
    <p>We now deactivated the Swarm Initial Field Model. This updates both views to show the original Swarm product data, as you can see in the virtual globe as well as in the Analytics Viewer.</p>
    <p>You can modify the selected time interval on the bottom time-slider if you wish to browse through the Swarm data a little further.</p>

    <h3>Satellite differences</h3>
    <p>As demonstrated before by selecting a Swarm and Model product we can see the residuals. It is also possible to see the differences in measurements between two Swarm satellites by activating two Swarm products. This is what we have done now.</p>
    <p>The difference is calculated by searching for the nearest (based on position) measurement of the second selected satellite product. The time difference between both measurements is used as offset for the selected time span to select which measurement is substracted with which of the second Satellite product.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This are the main features related to Swarm Analytics. Feel free to move the time interval selection in the time line to browse through the Swarm data, activate other models, try out the download functionality or just play around with the Prototype.</p>
